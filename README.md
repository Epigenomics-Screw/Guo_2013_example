The authors describe a technique that enables single-cell and single-base resolution DNA methylation analysis using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (scRRBS), detecting the methylation status of up to 1.5 million CpG sites within the genome of an individual mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC). They show that in a haploid sperm cell the technique detects the status of individual CpG site methylation in a digitized manner, either as unmethylated or fully methylated. They also show that tracing of the demethylation dynamics of maternal and paternal genomes after fertiliziation is possible within the individual pronuclei of mouse zygotes. Using their method they propose the ability to explore at single-base resolution the dynamic methylome landscapes of individual cells in physiological and pathological processes, such as embryonic development or tumorigenesis.
